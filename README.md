# CalculatorProject

## Description

This is a simple calculator project developed in Java, using the Swing library to create the graphical interface. The application allows you to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The project was created in NetBeans and packaged as an executable `.jar` file, allowing the application to be run in any environment with Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

## Features

- **Addition** (`+`)
- **Subtraction** (`-`)
- **Multiplication** (`*`)
- **Division** (`/`)
- **Clear** (`C`)
- **Backspace** (button to delete the last character)
- **Numeric keypad** (0-9)
- **Decimal point** (`.`)

## Technologies Used

- **Java SE**
- **Java Swing** (for graphical interface)
- **NetBeans IDE** (for development and compilation)

## Prerequisites

To run the `.jar` file, you need to have the **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** installed. For developers who want to modify the project, you'll need the **Java Development Kit (JDK)** and a development environment such as **NetBeans**.

### Checking the Java installation:

In the terminal or command prompt, run the following command to verify if Java is installed:

```bash
java -version
