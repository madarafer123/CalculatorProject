# CalculatorProject
 
Description
This is a simple calculator project developed by me in Java, using the Swing library to create the graphical interface. The application allows you to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The project was created in NetBeans and packaged as an executable .jar file, allowing the application to be run in any environment with Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

## Features

- **Addition** (`+`)
- **Subtraction** (`-`)
- **Multiplication** (`*`)
- **Division** (`/`)
- **Clear** (`C`)
- **Backspace** (button to delete the last character)
- **Numeric keypad** (0-9)
- **Decimal point** (`.`)

## Technologies Used

- **Java SE**
- **Java Swing** (for graphical interface)
- **NetBeans IDE** (for development and compilation)


Prerequisites
To run the .jar file, you need to have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. For developers who want to modify the project, you'll need the Java Development Kit (JDK) and a development environment such as NetBeans.

Checking the Java installation:
In the terminal or command prompt, run:
java -version

How to Run the ProjectRun the .jar
Download or clone this repository.
Navigate to the directory where the .jar file is located.
Run the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
java -jar Calculator.jar

The calculator interface will open and be ready to use.

Running the project in NetBeansImport the project into NetBeans.
Navigate to the CalculatorProject.java file.
Run the project (Shift + F6 or click on the ‘Run’ icon).
Project structure
Calculator.java: Main class that contains the logic for the graphical interface and mathematical operations.
CalculatorProject.java: Class that contains the main() entry point and is responsible for starting the graphical interface.
Recent changes
Entry point correction: The main() method has been adjusted to start the calculator interface automatically.
Packaging of the executable: The project has been compiled and packaged as a .jar file to facilitate distribution and execution.
